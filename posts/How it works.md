Well There are a few domains that you can refer to in order to access the Server
- [Blog Site](http://www.carmeliarose.shop)
- [My Calibre Server](http://read.carmeliarose.shop)
- [Jellyfin Media Server](http://jellyfin.carmeliarose.shop)
- [coder server](http://code.carmeliarose.shop), [coder server domain 2](http://coder.carmeliarose.shop) there is a coding cloud server too, however i do not run it very often as VS code tunnels were more efficient.
- [QBittorrent Web Interface](http://torrents.carmeliarose.shop)
