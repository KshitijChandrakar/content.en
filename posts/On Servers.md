## Cloud
So What are we looking for in a web service provider?
here's what I'll base them on-
- Design Process - How complex the work is and weather or not it has a UI Designer
- Integration - How much of a pain is it to set up your own services on it
- Community - How big and supportive the community is
Here are the options
.   

| Option       | Rating (Out of 15) | Design | Integration | Community | Remarks                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

| Wordpress    | 15                 | 5      | 5           | 5         | Pretty Good For begginers, You can Get a site up pretty quickly, Pretty Decent Community, Lots of themes                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Neocities    | 9                  | 2      | 2           | 5         | Personal Favorite, Amazing Community, Great if you want to Configure Stuff Yourself, Not so great when you want to do it quickly, uploading files is finicky. But an Amazing Place to host stuff if you want  community that appreciates the old style of internet                             |
| Github Pages | 8                  | 2      | 5           | 1         | Absolute Best Place to host your website, Domains are a bit finicky to set up but overall its done only once. You Get a Free Domain too. Integrates amazingly with other services but the design process is very manual and you have to provide the files/build yourself. Otherwise Very good. |

## Selfhosted
This is for webservers you can host yourself, would not recommend this method if you want a website that runs continously, since you'll have to have the host machine running. Other than that this would be the most secure option.

| Apache      | 7                  | Kinda Old at the point of writing but works amazingly, you have better options out there, Very Manual.                                                                                  |
| Hugo Server | 9                  | Amazing thing, great for testing servers, also works for production. Technically its a site builder but the inbuilt server is pretty great and has amazing integrations with everything |
