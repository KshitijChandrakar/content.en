Murderers.
They kill your soul,
They are pointed journalism to the world's soul,
Stabbing it strategically to kill the inhabitants,
which show on my wrists,

They Maim and Kill.
I do not exist and neither does my soul
and yet they stab at it,
and scream my name,
even when I am Untitled in my brain.
