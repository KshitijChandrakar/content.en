Rational agent is one that does the right thing. Conceptually every entry in the table, for the agent function is filled out correctly.  when an agent is plunked down in an environment, it generates a sequence of actions according to the percents it receives, this sequence of actions causes the environment to go through a sequence of states if the sequence is desirable, then the agent has performed well. this notion of desirability is captured by a performance measure that evaluates any given sequence of environmental states
