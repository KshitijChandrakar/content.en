In 1694, Gregory and Newton discussed the following problem: Can a rigid material ball
be brought into contact with thirteen other such balls of the same size? Gregory believed
“yes”, while Newton thought “no”.

Please Check attached image to see the kissing numbers for n dimensions
Let B^n denote the n-dimensional unit ball centered at the origin of E^n. The kissing
numbers $${κ^∗(B^n)}\text{ and }{κ(B^n)}$$denote the translative kissing number and the lattice kissing number of B^n.
Thus Summarizing [https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17340]:

I Propose a method to find $$k^*(B^n)$$ by using gravity in n-dimensions along with turbulence of the central sphere.
